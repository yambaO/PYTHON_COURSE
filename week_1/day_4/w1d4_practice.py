# 1. Write the code below that verifies the amount (length) of US States!
print(len(us_state))

# 2. create a variable my_state_index and assign the index value of the state you currently reside in
my_state_index = 42


# 3. let's see if you were right.. uncomment below and run. Do you see your state?


print("My state is: " + us_state[my_state_index])

# 4.Using your state index, let's emphasize some importance to it by *upper*casing it.
    # ASSIGN us_state with my_state_index with us_state of my_state_index with the UPPER method
us_state[my_state_index] = us_state[my_state_index].upper()

# PRINT us_state to see if there is a change in your state
# print(us_state)

# 5. POOF. You've been promoted to President! Let's add a new state. I like my list to be alphabetical (which it is)

# So let's go ahead and create a state that starts with Z and append it to the end of the list.
us_state.append("Zaire")

# 6. There is no state that begins with B! Lets create one and INSERT it appropriately. (There are 4 A states.)
us_state.insert(4, "Blue")

# 7. Does anyone live in Iowa? Do you know anyone that lives there? Is it even real?! Remove it.. Do it president.
us_state.remove("Iowa")
