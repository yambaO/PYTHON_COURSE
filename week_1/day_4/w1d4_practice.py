# 1. Write the code below that verifies the amount (length) of US States!

# 2. create a variable my_state_index and assign the index value of the state you currently reside in

# 3. let's see if you were right.. uncomment below and run. Do you see your state?

# print("My state is: " + us_state[my_state_index])

# 4.Using your state index, let's emphasize some importance to it by *upper*casing it.
    # ASSIGN us_state with my_state_index with us_state of my_state_index with the UPPER method

# PRINT us_state to see if there is a change in your state

# 5. POOF. You've been promoted to President! Let's add a new state. I like my list to be alphabetical (which it is)
# So let's go ahead and create a state that starts with Z and append it to the end of the list.


# 6. There is no state that begins with B! Lets create one and INSERT it appropriately. (There are 4 A states.)

# 7. Does anyone live in Iowa? Do you know anyone that lives there? Is it even real?! Remove it.. Do it president.
