# ITP Week 1 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice

# a. assign a variable 'subtotal' to 17.75
subtotal = 17.50

# b. assign a variable 'tax_percentage' to .18
tax_percentage = .18

# c. assign a variable 'tax_amount' to the product of subtotal and tax_percentage 
tax_amount = subtotal * tax_percentage

# d. assign a variable 'total' to the sum of subtotal and tax_amount
total = subtotal + tax_amount

print("Total: " , total)

# Round numbers with function 

number = 1.52773
# print(round(number))
# print(round(number, 0))
# print(round(number, 1))

# IMPORT KEYWORD

import math

# print(math.ceil(number))
# print(math.floor(number))

# ASSIGMENT OPERATORS

# x = 5 
# x += 3
# x -= 3 
# x *= 3
# x /= 3 
# x %= 3
# x **= 3
# x //= 3

# print(" final result of x is equal to: ",   x)

# CASTING

# casting string to interger
string = "12"
print(type(string))
string = int(string)
print(type(string))
