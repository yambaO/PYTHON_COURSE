# ITP Week 2 Day 2 Exercise

# import the appropriate method from the correct module

# Import the workbook that you updated in today's practice from
# "./spreadsheets/inventory.xlsx"

# access and store the appropriate worksheet to the variable 'ws'

# Define a function called add_order_amount that takes in a single parameter called 'row'

    # IF the quantity is less or equal to than the threshold,

        # than calculate the order_amount (max_amount - quantity) 
        # assign the value to that row, column 6
# TIP: create variables for quantity, threshold, max_amount that retrieves the values first for cleanliness

# Perform a for..in loop through the range(2, len(inventory.rows))
#   - call the function add_order_amount() passing in the number of the range
