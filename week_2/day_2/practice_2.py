# ITP Week 2 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice 2

# Creating and Calling Functions

# Create a function called greetings that prints "Hello World!"

def greetings():
    print("Hello world")
   

# Call greetings and run this Python file
# greetings()

# Create a function called add_num: 
def add_num():

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
# print the sum of x and y
 x = 5
 y = 7
 sum = x + y
 print(sum)

 
# Call your function
 add_num()
# Create a function called subtract_num:
 def subtract_num():
   x = 10
   y = 3
 print(x - y) 
#  subtract_num()
    
# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 3 to y
# print the difference of x and y
 

# Call your function

# Create a function called multiply_num:

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
# print the product of x and y

# Call your function


# Create a function called divide_num:

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 2 to y
# print the quotient of x divided by y

# Call your function
