# Dictionary

# create a new dictionary named my_person with one key value pair of name : [YOUR_NAME]

# verify the type of my_person to be a dictionary by using type

# Next we will use a pre-made dictionary:

person_1 = {
    "first_name": "Scooby",
    "favorite_snack": "Rare Candy",
    "wears_glasses": True
    }

# add a key value pair to person_1 with the last_name of Doo

# update person_1 favorite_snack to "Scooby Snacks"

# Remove the "wears_glasses" key:value from person_1
